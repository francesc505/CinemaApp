Here is the CinemaApp , developed using Android Studio. The main idea of this application is to use a json file, from whom i take the datas to build the application. 
That's the example of the json file: 


As you can see, i used the main points like: stars, hours, link of the image.
First of all the user must login, and after he is able to see all the movies available. This is a simply app, you can imporve it adding the localitation to show to the people only the films available near him. 
The json file contains the cinemas where the specific film is now available using an array. there is a botton who allows you to put your current position and automatically  insert the destination, 
for this reason i suggest to you to be ad dynamic as possibile.
